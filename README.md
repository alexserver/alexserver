### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Web Engineer, mainly focused on Front End ecosystems, like [React](https://react.dev/) and [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/), Although I've worked as a Full Stack with [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en), I feel more comfortable and I think I'm more productive working with the UI than with servers.

In the last years, I've worked with teams building SPAs (Single Page Apps) for companies like [Freestar](https://freestar.com/), [Spot2Nite](https://www.spot2nite.com/), and [Convert](https://www.convert.com/) using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [RactiveJs](https://ractive.js.org/) respectively.

I can work with a Web App Product from End to End, bootstrapping the repo from scratch, designing the project architecture, configuring the test suite, and setting up the CI/CD pipeline. I can even adapt to existing environments and learn the required technologies to be proficient in the project.

I enjoy working with all types of teams, from cross-functional to homogeneous ones, depending on the necessities of the company. I value investing in developing communication skills, to craft the art of working with people, for I believe soft skills are protagonists in any working environment, and they impact heavily on the success or failure of solving problems in highly efficient teams.
