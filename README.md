### Hi there 👋

I’m a Senior Web Engineer with a primary focus on Front End Applications. I have over 18 years of experience working with Web Technologies, with a strong emphasis on building User Interfaces.

I enjoy building amazing Web Products transforming UI/UX designs into highly maintainable, efficient, well-tested, and readable code solutions.
My dedication to the products I work on is comprehensive, from end to end. I understand and respect the significance of meeting deadlines while consistently delivering high-quality software. 

I’m an advocate of the Kaizen principle, which promotes the idea that constant, incremental improvement is the key to achieving lasting and impactful success.

My mantra is _“Progress, not perfection”._
