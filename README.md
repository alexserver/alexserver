### Hi there 👋

I'm a Web Engineer with more than 15 years working with web technologies, particularly in Front-End in the last few years.

I've been working with companies that have aided the growth of entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized businesses through the services they offer, from A/B testing, online reservation applications, and programmatic advertising. 

As a Software Engineer, I do my best to build high-quality web products, getting involved in all stages of development, such as project planning, product specifications, interface design, system design, testing, implementation, and the CI/CD pipeline.

I'm an advocate of the Kaizen principle, which promotes the idea that constant, incremental improvement is the key to achieving lasting and impactful success

My mantra is “Progress, not perfection”.
