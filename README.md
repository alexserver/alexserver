### Hi there 👋

I am a Web Engineer with over 18 years of experience in Web technologies, particularly in Front End.

I've had the privilege of working for companies that have had a significant impact on the global economy through the internet. These companies have aided the growth of small entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized businesses through the platforms they offer, from AB testing, online reservation applications, to online advertising.

My greatest passion as a Software Engineer is building high-quality web products. I can participate in all stages of development, from product specifications, interface and system architecture design, to the execution of the development process, user testing, and implementation.

In all activities regarding the product creation I tend to prioritize the user experience and product quality.

I'm an advocate of the Kaizen principle, which promotes the idea that constant, incremental improvement is the key to achieving lasting and impactful success

My mantra is “Progress, not perfection”.
